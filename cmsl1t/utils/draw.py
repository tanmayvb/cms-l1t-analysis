"""
I would rather not have had to do it this way, but I could see no alternative.
The TColor header defines an enum for the palettes:
https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/TColor_8h.html#acb46d776ab87271c3fc10b14c50b169c
In rootpy (or pyROOT) these are accessible as attributes of ROOT however, since
the enum is not defined within the TColor class, just in the header file the
enums end up in the global ROOT namespace.  As a result, it would not really be
possible to check that a given string is actually a root palette, and not just
some method / class / variable in the ROOT namespace.  This solves this by
copying in the valid list of strings from the above link so that we can
validate that a requested palette actually exists in ROOT.
